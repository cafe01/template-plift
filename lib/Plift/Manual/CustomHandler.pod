=head1 INTRODUCTION

This page describes how to attach custom processing handlers on the L<Plift>
template engine.

=head1 WHAT IS A HANDLER?

Besides the data interpolation feature, the Plift engine has just one core
funcionality that is to search the HTML document using registered xpath
expressions and triggering the associated subroutines.

A handler is just a perl subroutine bound to a xpath expression, usualy targgeting
a element or attribute (like C<< <x-include> >> or C<data-plift-include>).

The following example attaches a handler to the HTML C<< <head> >> element:

    $plift->add_handler({
        name    => 'head_example',
        tag     => 'head',
        handler => sub {

            my ($head_element, $context) = @_;

            # do you custom processing on the <head> element:
            # - add SEO metadata?
            # - process asset files?
            # - add tracking code?

        }
    });


I encourage you to read the source of the builtin handlers. They a very simple,
just a few lines of code.

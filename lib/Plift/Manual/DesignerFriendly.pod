When your application templates are just pure HTML5 files, it becomes easy for
the front-end developers to work with almost no coordination with the backend team.
Even if you buy a "website theme" from one of those online markets, which of
course wasn't developed to your application, is very easy to slice it into
'layout', 'header', 'footer' and 'content' tempalte files.
